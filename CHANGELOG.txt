2016-07-XX   1.1.0:
-------------------
  * add recipe size limit and disallow files with certain extensions
  * add more checking for info/has_prefix in conda packages, in particular
    ensure that the binary placeholder length is 255 bytes on Unix, as
    conda-build 2.0 will start using this value.  We already use conda-build
    master for building packages on repo.continuum.io, and want to enforce
    255 bytes for all new packages, in order to make the transition to
    conda-build easier for the community.
  * add check for header in build.sh
  * add checking for non-ASCII in info/index.json and info/has_prefix


2016-06-30   1.0.0:
-------------------
  * initial release
